## Reddit Eclipse Discord | Eclipse Bot

Reddit Eclipse *(one of the best RCS clans out there)* has its own bot? Why, yes it does!

The bot's prefix is `+`, so check out its commands by doing `+help`.

The source code for Eclipse Bot is private.
However, if you find an issue or error with the bot while on our Discord server, please head over to the [issues page](https://github.com/Luis729/reddit-eclipse-bot/issues) and write an issue. Same goes if you have a request to be implemented into the bot.
